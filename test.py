#Task 2
'''Objective: Let L1 be a list of first 100 randomly generated integer numbers in the range [1,
100], let L2 be the integers within the range [1, 100] that are divisible by either 3 or 4.
(1) Use list comprehension to generate L1, L2
(2) Form a set S1 and a frozen set S2 from L1 and L2 respectively.
(3) Create a new set R1 to contain those elements are either in S1 or in S2. Print out how many
elements in R1.
(4) Create a new set R2 to contain those elements are in both S1 and in S2. Print out how many
elements in R2.
(5) Create a new set R3 to contain those elements are in S1 but not in S2. Print out how many
elements in R3'''

L1 = [random.randint(1,100) for i in range(100)]
print("L1:",L1)
L2 = [x for x in range(1,100) if (x%3==0 or x%4==0)]
S1 = set(L1)
S2 = frozenset(L2)
print("S1:",S1)
print("S2:",S2)
#XOR of S1 and S2 
R1 = S1^S2
print("R1:",R1)
print("There are %d elements in R1" % len(R1))
#Intersection of S1 and S2
R2 = S1 & S2
print("R2:",R2)
print("There are %d elements in R2" % len(R2))
#Difference of S1 versus S2 (S1 - S2)
R3 = S1 - S2
print("R3:",R3)
print("There are %d elements in R3" % len(R3))
