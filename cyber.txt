computers, networks, programs, or data that one intends to keep 
safe. In an organization,  people, processes,  technology 
must all complement one anor to create an effective defense 
from cyber attacks. A unified threat management system can automate 
integrations across select Cisco Security products  accelerate 
key security operations functions: detection, investigation,  
remediation. People Users must understand  comply with basic data 
security principles like choosing strong passwords, being wary of
